### Ground truth Diagram
The procedure to create ground truth is illustrated below. The diagram is created with [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/). The draw.io extensions in VSCode allows for more functionality when streamlined with Git.

Diagram legend:
- Orange and Yellow rectangular boxes: Different source code versions in the Version Control history. V<sub>n-1</sub> and V<sub>n</sub> represent the source code version of the pre-commit and post-commit revisions (i.e. including all commits actually made), while  V<sub>bug</sub> and V<sub>fix</sub> differ only by isolated bug fixes.
- Blue rectangles: UNIX Diff file formats that are converted into PatchSet Objects. In the program, we utilize OOP provided by the `unidiff` package by treating Diffs as PatchFiles - i.e. containing PatchSet, diff Line, etc. Objects. 
- Tables: DataFrames. To manipulate the diff PatchSets more easily, we finally convert the filtered PatchSets to DataFrame formats/CSV exports for empirical analysis in the succeeding steps of the evaluation framework. When PatchSet are converted into DataFrames, they are filtered.
- Green rounded boxes: the hashtagged (#) labels are actual names of code files/function calls/ Bash scripts, .etc that are invoked to produce the output indicated by the arrow. If the draw.io VSCode extension is installed with Code Links enabled, double-clicking on the hashtag allows for a workspace search for a symbol matching the rest of the label.

### Terminology
There are important diff artifacts, labelled 1, 2, 3 accordingly:
1. Version Control Diff (or original diff or programmer diff): The diff generated by VCS from the buggy revision (pre-commit) and fixed revision (post-commit) versions of the source code. This diff file is not filtered. 
2. Bug-Fix Diff (or minimal diff): A minimized Defects4J patch containing all bug-fixing lines, obtained by inverting the Defects4J bug-inducing patch. The line numbers of Bug-Fix Diff are repaired to match exactly with the Original Diff. This diff file is not filtered.
  - Note: the Bug-Fix Diff might not be a subset of Original Diff, as it may contain bug-fix portion of a tangled line (e.g. (4 + F)) - these are dropped when creating the ground truth. 
3. Non-Bug-Fix Diff:
  - Current implementation: The set difference {Orginal Diff \ Bug-Fix Diff} - which contains all the lines that are non-bug-fixing and tangled (as we drop bug-fix portions in ground truth). This diff file is not filtered.
  - Desired implementation: The UNIX diff of {buggy version, fixed version}, in which the fixed code is bug-fix-diff applied on original-diff (Original_diff(buggy) + Bug-fix_diff). We expect that this file contains only the non-bug-fixing portion of a tangled line and is filtered.

## Evaluation Pipeline
The diagram illustrates the evaluation pipeline implemented in the `evaluate.sh` script.
