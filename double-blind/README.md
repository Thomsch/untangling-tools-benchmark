The artifacts we give are the following:
- Evaluation framework source code
- Untangling dataset produced by the tools evaluated in the paper

### Evaluation framework source code
The evaluation framework source code is divided in two repositories. The first repository contain the evaluation framework and the second repository contains a modified implementation of an existing untangling tool. The instructions for installing evaluation framework are in the README at the root of the repository.

### Untangling dataset
The untangling dataset contains the artifacts produced by the untangling tools we evaluated. We include it because it's listed as a contribution on the paper.
